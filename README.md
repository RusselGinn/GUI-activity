NewDiary.java: Form for adding new entries and saving to file.

ViewDiaries.java: Displays all entries with a "Load" button to refresh data.

ViewSpecificDiaries.java: Allows searching by ID and includes a "Clear" button to reset results.

Technologies
Built with Java Swing for the GUI.

Uses file I/O (FileWriter, BufferedReader) for data persistence.

Simple error handling with JOptionPane for user feedback.

Usage

Use the buttons to add, view, or search entries.

Ensure the file path in the code matches your system before running.
